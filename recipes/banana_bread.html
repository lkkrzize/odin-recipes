    <h1>My Favorite Banana Bread Recipe</h1>
    <br>
    <p>With its super-moist and buttery texture, banana and brown sugar flavors, soft crumb, and 1,300+ reviews, this is a delicious AND undeniably popular banana bread recipe. You need 4 medium or 3 large ripe bananas.</p>
    <br>
    <strong>I originally published this recipe in 2013</strong> and have since added new photos and a few more success tips.

    <p>This is my favorite banana bread recipe, one that I’ve cherished for years. It’s one of those classic recipes that you start to know by heart, just like a good <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/baking-basics-homemade-buttery-flaky-pie-crust/">pie crust</a> or <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies/">chocolate chip cookies</a> recipe. This bread comes to mind first when I have leftover spotty bananas on the counter, and it’s the bread that’s on constant rotation in my freezer stash.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It’s one of the most popular recipes I’ve published on this website, out of over 1,200.</p>

    <p>Yes, I have this recipe on speed dial too! 😉</p>

    <p>I’ve tried dozens of banana bread recipes over the years, and when I baked and originally published this recipe many years ago, I never looked back.</p>

    <h2>How to Mash Bananas</h2>
    <p><strong>Did you know you can use your electric mixer to mash bananas?</strong> Break or slice the spotty bananas into large pieces and place in the bowl of your stand mixer—or use a regular mixing bowl and your hand mixer. Begin beating on low, then gradually increase to medium-high speed as the bananas break down into mashed banana. Transfer the bananas to another bowl and use the mixing bowl for the butter and sugar. (No need to clean it—some mashed banana remnants is fine.)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I do this when I mash a bananas for <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/banana-muffins/">banana muffins</a> and <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/banana-chocolate-chip-breakfast-cookies/">banana chocolate chip breakfast cookies</a> too.</p>

    <h2>Other Banana Bread Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Use softened butter for a soft texture and irresistible butter flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Sugar:</strong> Use all brown sugar in this recipe. In the headnotes for this <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies/">chocolate chip cookies</a> recipe, I explain that brown sugar yields soft and moist cookies. Well, brown sugar works that same magic in banana bread, too. It also adds wonderful flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs supply cakes, cupcakes, breads, doughs, and cookies their stability and structure, as well as a tender texture. You’ll need 2 large eggs for this.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sour Cream or Yogurt:</strong> Sour cream or yogurt adds even more moisture to this banana bread. (You can use the 2 interchangeably in most baking recipes.)</li>

    </ul>
