    <br>

    <br>
    <p><strong>I originally published this recipe in 2013</strong> and have since added new photos and a few more success tips.</p>

This bread comes to mind first when I have leftover spotty bananas on the counter, and it’s the bread that’s on constant rotation in my freezer stash.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It’s one of the most popular recipes I’ve published on this website, out of over 1,200.</p>

    <h2>How to Mash Bananas</h2>
    <p><strong>Did you know you can use your electric mixer to mash bananas?</strong> Break or slice the spotty bananas into large pieces and place in the bowl of your stand mixer—or use a regular mixing bowl and your hand mixer. Begin beating on low, then gradually increase to medium-high speed as the bananas break down into mashed banana. Transfer the bananas to another bowl and use the mixing bowl for the butter and sugar. (No need to clean it—some mashed banana remnants is fine.)</p>
    <br>
    <p>I do this when I mash bananas for <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/banana-muffins/">banana muffins</a> and <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/banana-chocolate-chip-breakfast-cookies/">banana chocolate chip breakfast cookies</a> too.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>285g plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>110g butter (plus more for greasing)</li>
        <li>225g caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
        <li>85ml buttermilk (or milk + 1½ tsp lemon juice)</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan). Grease a 900g loaf tin.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour, bicarbonate of soda, and salt into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, mashed bananas, buttermilk, and vanilla. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Fold in the dry ingredients until just combined—do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 1 hour, or until golden and a skewer inserted comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Cool in the tin for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you don’t have buttermilk, use milk with a splash of lemon juice or vinegar and let it sit for 10 minutes.</p>
