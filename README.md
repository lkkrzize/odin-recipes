# Odin Recipes

Welcome to my simple recipe website! This project was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) Foundations course to practice basic HTML skills.

## About

This site features a homepage with links to three of my favorite recipes:
- Banana Bread
- Chilli Beef Udon Noodles
- Air Fryer Peanut Chicken

Each recipe page includes:
- A title and images of the dish
- A short description and personal notes
- Ingredients and method (using lists and headings)
- Easy navigation back to the homepage

## What I Learned

Working on this project helped me:
- Structure HTML documents with proper boilerplate
- Link between pages using relative paths
- Use semantic HTML elements like headings, lists, and images
- Organize a small project with Git

## Getting Started

Just open `index.html` in your browser to explore the recipes.
